# countrs
This library provides a simple method for counting down to (or up from) a point in time that can be shifted back and forth.  
The primary motivation for the creation for this library is the concept of a marathon livestream, where the stream begins with a timer set to e.g. 4 hours at the beginning, and viewers can increase this time by paying.
