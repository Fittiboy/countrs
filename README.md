# About
This library provides a simple method for counting down to (or up from) a point in time that can be shifted back and forth.  

# Documentation
The latest documentation is available [here on docs.rs](https://docs.rs/countrs)!

# Motivation
The primary motivation for the creation of this library is the concept of a marathon livestream, where the stream begins with a timer set to e.g. 4 hours at the beginning, and viewers can increase this time by paying.
